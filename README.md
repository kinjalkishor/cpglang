cpglang Programming Language
cpglang is mostly like C & C++ with syntax like Pascal and Go. (C: C/C++/dlang, P: Pascal, G: Golang)
Features and Goals of cpglang -
- Fastest compile times. Using clang & dmd as backend.
- Easier to read, understand, parse syntax.
- Add long time demanded features to C/C++ like Modules, UFCS, SIMD.
- A subset of language (mainly without pointers) to be used as embedded scripting language.
- Make C/C++ safer. (Note: No borrow checker or Rust 
- Tries to solve ambiguity problems in parsing C/C++.
- No multiple inheritance.
